The following contains the following projects in the Junior Programmer Pathway.

## Contents

### Challenge 5
A food-themed clicking game challenge where players must click on falling food items while avoiding skulls. This challenge focuses on UI interactions, difficulty settings, and game state management.

### Error Project
A Unity debugging exercise designed to teach developers how to identify and fix common compilation errors in C# scripts. Includes practice with syntax errors, missing references, and proper Unity component setup.

### Prototype 1
Car driving simulation introducing fundamental Unity concepts including transforms, physics, and basic player input controls.

### Prototype 6
Advanced Unity game mechanics implementation featuring object pooling, collision detection, boundary management, and optimized performance techniques.

### Prototype 7 - Counting Project
An interactive counting system that tracks collisions with objects in a 3D environment. Features a trigger-based counter with UI display showing real-time count updates when spheres pass through a designated area.
